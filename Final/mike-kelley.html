<h1>Coaxial receives grant from Mike Kelley Foundation for support through the pandemic</h1>
<p>
    Coaxial Arts Foundation is excited to announce that we have received a generous grant from Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts to support Coaxial through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Director Eva Aguila was interviewed by the LA Times on receiving this grant:<br><br>

    <b>“We give artists a micro-honorarium,” said Coaxial Director Eva Aguila, “and this allows us to continue helping artists make work. And since we’re not making money from ticket sales, it’s helping us keep our doors open.”</b><br><br>
    
    This grant will support not only our ongoing work with livestreaming, but will allow Coaxial to keep our doors open (even though, for now, they are closed to the general public). Artists will receive micro-honorariums to present work on Coaxial‘s livestream, and Coaxial will be able to retain our physical space for creation of new work by artists.<br><br><button>BECOME A MEMBER</button></p>
