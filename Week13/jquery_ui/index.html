    <h3>Bananas</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Bananas were originally found in South East Asia, mainly in India. They were brought west by Arab conquerors in 327 B.C. and moved from Asia Minor to Africa and finally carried to the New World by the first explorers and missionaries to the Caribbean. The mass production of bananas started in 1834 and really started exploding in the late 1880’s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Apples</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        DNA analysis indicates that apples originated in the mountains of Kazakhstan, where the wild Malus sieversii—the many-times great-grandparent of Malus domestica, the modern domesticated apple—still flourishes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Mango</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Mangoes originated in India over 4,000 years ago and are considered a sacred fruit. Mangoes spread gradually throughout Asia and then to the rest of the world. Due to a mango's large center seed, the fruit relied on humans to transport them across the world.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Pineapple</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Pineapples come originally from South America, most probably from the region between South Brazil and Paraguay. From here, pineapples quickly spread around the continent up to Mexico and the West Indies, where Columbus found them when visiting Guadeloupe in 1493.
